When we initiate a repo using git init a .git directory is place inside the rep which contains all the meta data for the history of previous versions of the file.

It is because staging area helps me to control one by one how many files i want to commit at once instead of commiting all the files at once or each file one by one.

By adding the files that make one logical change

When i want to experiment a new change to my original app and want a fully working thing alongside i will use branches. This helps in keeping my new feature seperated.
