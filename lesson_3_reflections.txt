When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository when i want to other developers to collaborate on my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to pull changes manually rather than having git automatically doin it for me as when I need those changes then only I will pull it.
